# Smiles and Skulls
This is the open-source project for Smiles and Skulls! It includes music, audio, sprites and the GameMaker file! If you'd like to add something into the game, create a new branch and name it ***YOUR*** GitHub username. I will not accept anything else. Enjoy playing around!

# Beta edition!
This is the beta branch! You can see what is coming in the game next before anyone else! Pull requests for this branch are accepted first, however, to avoid confusion, name your beta branch: beta-***githubusername***.
If you see this in the ***master*** branch, do not worry, as pull requests will be put in ***master***, and it may be time before I remove this.
